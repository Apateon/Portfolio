											<h2><b>Tower Capture</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>For the demonstration of my expertise in AI and simulation, I developed 
											a dynamic tower defense game using C++ and the OpenGL Mathematics library (GLM). 
											This engaging game featured towers that launched physics-modeled projectiles, while 
											intelligent agents employed advanced pathfinding algorithms to strategically navigate 
											the terrain, influencing the towers. By seamlessly integrating AI-driven agent 
											behavior and physics-based simulations, I showcased a comprehensive understanding of AI 
											principles and simulation techniques. This project underscores my ability to create immersive 
											gaming experiences while applying intricate AI strategies, all within the realm of interactive simulations.</p>

											<h2><b>Rocket Simulation</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>I created a 3D rocket simulation using DirectX for a project in the "C++ Programming and 
											Design in Real-Time Graphics" module. The simulation depicted a rocket following an arcing 
											trajectory, accompanied by a particle system that simulated jet propulsion. Additionally, 
											I incorporated ray tracing to portray the sun and moon realistically. Various rendering 
											techniques, including textures, bump maps, and normal maps, were utilized to enhance the 
											visual appeal of the scene. This project effectively demonstrates my proficiency in C++ programming, 
											DirectX rendering, and the practical application of graphics technologies.</p>

										<p>I collaborated with a skilled team of four to develop "Troublesome Tanks," a top-down tank shooting game 
											using Unity. This project exemplified our cohesive teamwork, as we harnessed source control applications 
											to seamlessly integrate individual contributions and tackle weekly assignments. By leveraging our respective 
											strengths, we efficiently divided roles and responsibilities, mirroring a professional development environment. 
											This experience not only showcased our effective teamwork but also expanded our game development skill set, 
											enhancing our proficiency in Unity and providing valuable insights into real-world project management dynamics.</p>

											<h2><b>Santa Sleigh</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>I enthusiastically participated in the "Three Thing Game Jam" at the University of Hull, 
											collaborating with friends to create an innovative game within a tight 48-hour timeframe. 
											Guided by three given words, we showcased our rapid game development abilities, 
											successfully crafting a playable game that highlighted our adaptability and quick problem-solving 
											skills. This intense project provided invaluable insights into managing time constraints 
											and effectively delegating tasks among team members. As each of us assumed responsibility 
											for different aspects of the game, we not only demonstrated our ability to work cohesively under 
											pressure but also expanded our proficiency in quick prototyping and game design iteration. 
											This experience underscored our capacity to transform creative concepts into functional games within demanding time limits.</p>

											<h2><b>The Culinarian</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>As a part of my final year project in my undergraduate degree, I teamed up with a partner 
											to create a practical web application. Using PHP, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, we built a 
											user-friendly recipe suggestion website. This platform allowed users to find recipes based on the
											 ingredients they had on hand. The website also featured community-contributed recipes that could
											  be rated by users. This project provided a hands-on learning experience, enhancing my skills in 
											  PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, it offered insights into collaborative work, web development, and user-focused design principles.</p>

										<h2>Drawing Game</h2>
										<p>
											In the ongoing project for the "Games Architecture, Network, and Concurrency" module, I'm developing an interactive 
											drawing game using C++ and glm. This innovative game facilitates multiplayer engagement, where each participant is 
											granted a voxel-based canvas. As players draw, random voxel theft occurs from others, resulting in blackened voxels on 
											their respective canvases. By adhering to game engine principles, this project adeptly illustrates my grasp of 
											networking concepts and game architecture. Through this endeavor, I'm showcasing my ability to craft engaging multiplayer 
											experiences while employing advanced game development techniques, solidifying my expertise in both network programming and game engine design.

										<h2>MSc. Dissertation</h2>
										<p>
											I am currently engaged in the development of an innovative mixed reality airway examination simulator for 
											medical training. This simulator leverages cutting-edge technology to create an immersive and interactive environment 
											where users can navigate a virtual tracheobronchial tree using a realistic bronchoscope. The ongoing project aims to enhance 
											medical education by offering a hands-on experience in airway examination, fostering technical skills and procedural 
											competence. As part of the development process, user feedback is being incorporated to refine the simulator's functionality 
											and user experience. This endeavor reflects my commitment to advancing medical training through the integration of mixed reality solutions.
